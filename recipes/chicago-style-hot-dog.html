      <strong>Chicago-Style Hot Dog</strong>
      <p>
      <em>Not to be confused with a</em> <b>REGULAR</b> <em>hot dog</em>.
    </p>
     So,
      just what is on a &ldquo; Chicago style &rdquo; hot dog? Well, it starts
      with a steamed <i>poppy seed</i> bun and an all-beef frankfurter. Then
      it's topped with yellow mustard, bright green relish, fresh chopped
      onions, juicy red tomato wedges, a kosher-style pickle spear, a couple of
      spicy sport peppers and finally, a dash of <i>celery salt</i>.
