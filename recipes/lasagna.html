      <strong>Lasagna Recipe</strong>
      Lasagna originated in <i>Italy</i> during the Middle Ages. The oldest
      transcribed text about lasagna appears in 1282 in the Memoriali Bolognesi
      (&ldquo; Bolognesi Memorials &rdquo;), in which lasagna was mentioned in a
      poem transcribed by a Bolognese notary; while the first recorded recipe
      was set down in the early 14th-century Liber de Coquina
      <b>(The Book of Cookery)</b>
